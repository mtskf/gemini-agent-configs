# Self-Correction Checklist

Before committing or finalizing the task, perform the following checks:

- [ ] **Complexity**: Is the solution as simple as possible? (YAGNI/KISS)
- [ ] **Naming**: Do variable/function names match `docs/TECH_STACK.md` conventions?
- [ ] **Hygiene**: Did I remove all `console.log` / debug comments?
- [ ] **Context**: Does this change align with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`?
- [ ] **Tests**: Did I run existing tests (`pnpm test` etc.) and pass?
- [ ] **Docs**: Did I update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and other relevant docs?
